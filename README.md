# Real-time dual-grid tileset

A real-time, in-editor version of [GlitchedInOrbit](https://github.com/GlitchedinOrbit/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot-gdscript)'s implementation, based on [jess::codes' C# dual grid system](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot).  

The previous version used an inverted version of the official 16-tile template. This version corrects the inversion.

## TO-DO
- Real-time tilemap sync
- Isometric port
